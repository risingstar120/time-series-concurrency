# Java concurrency with ComposableFuture example

This is an example for a blog post I'm writing.

To run the program:

```shell
mvn clean compile exec:java
```

## Preface

Suppose we want to calculate an *air quality index* based on two values:

- air temperature
- percentage of carbon monoxide in the air

We may calculate the *air quality index* with the following formula:

<!-- 
(temperature * carbonMonoxidePercentage) / maxTemperature
-->

`TODO:` link the blog post here when I'm done.
